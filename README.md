# RayCast Engine

A simple **RayCasting Engine** that converts a **2D tile map** into a **3D world**. This project is primarily a tech demo showcasing the rendering engine, rather than a full game.

## Features
- **Walls with Different Textures** 
- **Decorations & Entities** 
  - **Tiles**: Currently supports **two different tile types** (more coming soon!)
  - **Decorations**: Includes objects like a **campfire** 
  - **Entities**: Features a **goblin** and a **skeleton** roaming the world
- **Easily Configurable Map Size** üó∫Ô∏è (Currently set to **8x8**, but easily changeable in the code)

## Known Issues & Future Improvements
- **Cursor Lock Bug**: If the program runs in the background, the cursor remains locked in the center of the screen.
- **Exit Handling**: For now, press **Alt + F4** to exit. A proper menu with exit options will be added later.

## Notes
- This project is built **entirely by a single developer**.
- Bug fixes, additional tiles, and more features are planned for future updates.

Stay tuned for updates!
